# To-Do-List-App
To Do List App created using Kotlin. Each and every task is added to Room database, and the task deletion is handled by deletion of that specific task from the Database. Recycleview is used to display the tasks, and tasks are added through a fragment, which has the option of date picker too. The tasks have dynamic numbering on it, if I delete a task from middle, the numbering will be updated of the total tasks.
